Hello World Repo

Hello fellow humans,

I'm a Post-Bacc CS student at Oregon State looking to enter into a computer science field. I've done some front end web development and wouldn't mind entering into front and back web dev in the future. I also enjoy graphic design adn how people interact with media, so user experience and interface is another area of intrest.

I mainly code in HTML and CSS but look forward to learning more. Currently taking C++ classes.
